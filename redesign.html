		<h1 class="portfolio-title">Redesigning "An Ordinary Day"</h1>
		<p>
			An Ordinary Day is a collaborative text adventure website that I built my senior year of high school. It was the first full website that I ever built, and… it shows. The design is less than stellar, with confusing instructions, a complete lack of a color scheme, and little to no layout structure. </br></br>

I thought redesigning the website would be a cool way to see how much I’ve improved over the years, and a way to give back, in a sense, to the site that first sparked my passion for computer science. I focused my efforts on first increasing the usability of the site, and then improving the visual design.

		</div>

		<h2>Usability Redesign</h2>
		<p>
		I applied the concepts we learned in class to identify usability issues with the website. The six usability criteria I looked are were: <strong>intuitive design, ease of learning, efficiency of use, memorability, error frequency and severity, and subjective satisfaction.</strong> I identified a number of issues with the site, but the worst ones that I found were that:
		<ol>
			<li>The user profile page, as a whole, is confusing. The layout and font decisions do not make sense; it's hard to tell which cells in the table are the content, which are the headers, and which headers match with which content.</li></br>
		<li>The search tools are simple, which makes them easy to use. However, it makes finding specifically what you want an annoyingly long process.</li></br>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<div class="two-col">
			<div class="left-col">
				<img style="border: 1px solid black;" class="img-col" src="./images/odgUserProfile.png" alt="Original user profile page"/>
				<p class="img-subtitle">User profile page</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right-col">
				<img style="border: 1px solid black;" class="img-col" src="./images/odgExplore.png" alt="Original search page"/>
				<p class="img-subtitle">The explore/search page</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
		I used my findings to create upgraded wireframes for five of the main pages of An Ordinary Day. Note the redesigned user profile page, and the improved search features on the Explore page.

		<h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
		<p>Once I had addressed the structural issues with the site, I moved on to address the visual design of the site. Specifically, I focused on improving the layout, color scheme, and typeface of the website. I used the Barnes and Noble website for inspiration, to emphasize the literariness of the website. 
		</p></br>

		</br></br>
		<p>Once I had the visual design for the desktop version of An Ordinary Day’s homepage, I kept working to make it responsive:</p>
		<div class="img-wrapper"><img class="content-img" src="./images/responsiveRedesign.png" alt="Annotated version of the above mockup to show responsiveness"/></div></br>
		<p>The new version of the website is significantly easier to understand and use, looks much nicer, and scales well to mobile. Overall, the redesign was a success!</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>For usability, this project taught me and drove home the concept of the six usability criteria. In terms of visual design, this project really drove home the usefulness of flexbox and grid layout. Having everything align feels so nice! This project taught me, too, that creating a responsive site does not have to be especially difficult. In the past, I had built sites and tried to add responsiveness in later, but building one with responsiveness in mind from the start was much easier than I expected.
