		<p>
		As a software developer, one of the biggest issues I've come across is building a beautiful piece of software, sharing it with the world, and then watching it gather dust because no one can figure out how it works. What is intuitive to me, as a developer, can be confusing for my software's intended audience.
		</p>
		<p>It turns out that there's an easy UI/UX solution to this problem: <strong>user testing</strong>. User testing allows designers and developers to test specific hypotheses about how users will interact with their software, as well as bring to light inaccurate mental models or other sources of confusion for users, before anything is even built. Designers create a prototype of the product, and then set tasks for users to complete using the interface. Designers also present qualitative questions about the interface and the task. This allows designers and developers to gain valuable insight into how users approach their product, and what they can do to make it better.  
		</p>
		<p>

		<h2>User Testing in Action</h2>
		<p>I applied user testing to a mobile website for an imaginary company called Memphis Taxi Co. to determine how to best improve the site and learn about common user errors.</p></br>
		
		<div class="img-wrapper"><img src="./images/memphis.png" class="content-img"></div></br>
		<p>I made a mobile <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5SOUCZK8BCJ#/screens">prototype</a> of the the Memphis Taxi template, given to us by the TAs of my UI/UX class, and submitted it to <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com</a>. I gave my three users the task of reserving the cheapest taxi to pick them up from the airport. </br></br>I had two hypotheses about the results of user testing:
		<ol>
			<li>Comparing taxi services using the site is difficult.</li>
			<li>The task would be made easier if there were price listings on the homepage.</li></br>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<div class="img-wrapper">
			<img src="./images/memphisprototype.png" class="content-img">
			<p class="img-subtitle">Selected screens from the prototype</p>
		</div></br>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<table class="table">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th scope="col">Task</th>
					<th scope="col">Completion Rate</th>
					<th scope="col">Error Count</th>
					<th scope="col">Time on Task</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Reserve the cheapest taxi to pick you up from the airport</td>
					<td>66%</td>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>Average: 79.33 seconds</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<h6>Errors</h6>
		<p>The major errors that occurred were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Users didn’t see the fourth taxi company because they didn’t know they could scroll down.</li>
			<li>Users initially assumed the homepage buttons reserved the taxi. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Two users figured out that they needed to click a button on a taxi-specific page to reserve a taxi, but one user did not, hence the 66% completion rate. Users seemed annoyed that they had to figure this out. The time to complete the task is high because every user, after seeing the price for one taxi company, went back to the homepage to then check the prices of every other taxi company. Overall, users were confused when they initially saw the site, but once they clicked to one of taxi-specific pages, they became more confident navigating the app. The users that completed the task seemed satisfied at the end, but the user that didn’t complete the task was not satisfied. 
		</p>
		<h4>User Testing Conclusion</h4>
		<p>In terms of the hypotheses, my first hypothesis was disproved, while my second was supported by user testing. All users ranked the task as “easy” after completing it, which contradicts my first hypothesis. However, two of the users mentioned that they were frustrated by the lack of pricing information on the homepage, and the third said that they would add pricing information to the homepage as a way to improve the site. Therefore, their responses supported my second hypothesis.
		</p>
		<p>To improve the interface, I would encourage users to scroll by modifying the layout so that part of the first item on the hidden, scrollable part of the page is showing when the user first loads the page. I would also change the text on the homepage buttons to say “See Pricing and Reservation Info for ____,” instead of saying “Reserve.” As such, users would know that clicking the buttons on the first page does not make reservations with the taxi companies. Finally, I would list price ratings ($, $$, $$$, and $$$$) on the homepage so that users do not have to check every taxi company’s information to compare their prices. 
		</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>My user testing experience was more informative than I expected. I didn’t think about the text on the homepage buttons at all when I was designing the prototype, but it caused the users a lot of trouble. I also forgot to ensure that some of the scrollable content was visible, and I didn’t realize how important that was. Many users saw the scrollbar appear when they were using the homepage, but still didn’t scroll. In general, I found the results of user testing to yield useful, implementable information that directly impacts the design of the app; it brought attention to significant issues that I was not previously aware of. </p>
