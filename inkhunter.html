		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		“Think before you ink.”  
		</br></br>
A tattoo is a decision that will follow you forever. Inkhunter is a augmented reality app that allows users to “try on” a tattoo to see how it would look on their skin, before making the final decision to book an appointment with a tattoo artist. As a startup, Inkhunter fills the gap between thinking about getting a tattoo and actually committing to an artist or shop. Inkhunter enables an expanded exploratory phase when thinking about tattoo possibilities.
</br></br>
We chose to work with this idea because of the unique challenges that it poses. There’s an incredible amount of variability in tattoo styles, placements, and design. Users need to be able to experiment with a variety of different ideas seamlessly.
</br></br>
Our design is a mobile app in order to make use of smartphones’ augmented reality capabilities. Because Inkhunter’s primary functionality is A/R and photo curation, a mobile app is the natural choice. Designing for mobile allows users to view the tattoo through their phones in 3D, reposition it easily, and draw inspiration for a tattoo while on the go.

		<p>
		To develop our prototype, we went through several increasingly high fidelity iterations. First, each team member did a low-fi paper sketch of their proposed interface (<em>Figs 1–4</em>).
		</br></br>
		In <em>Fig 1</em>, the app is modeled around an artist vs. customer dichotomy. Artists curate galleries of their tattoo designs and use Inkhunter to advertise to potential customers. Customers browse for artists based near them, try out tattoos using the app’s A/R camera features, and might eventually travel to the artist whose design they like best and get a real tattoo.
		</br></br>
		<em>Fig 2</em>, on the other hand, does not distinguish between artists and customers. Instead, all users upload their own images to a personal library and can take A/R photos of tattoos in their library.
		</br></br>
		<em>Fig 3</em> is also based around a single user category, but users can also make the photos they upload public. Most users, therefore, would simply search for tattoo designs on the app rather than uploading their own. Artists might upload designs, but would not have a dedicated app interface for personal advertising and curation.
		</br></br>
		<em>Fig 4</em> is similar to <em>Fig 3</em> in approach, but also includes photo-editing and sharing capabilities. Every user has a personal library (for storing A/R tattoo photos) and a public profile (for sharing their own designs). This adds a social element to the application.
		</p>
		<h4>Hi-fi Prototype: Iteration 1</h4>
		<p>
		In the first iteration of our prototype (<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/aJbJktEq8RvmG3XMSQSK1Cgr/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">view here</a>), we combined elements from each of the initial designs. Our primary goal was to facilitate two fundamentally different use cases:
		<ol>
			<li>Certified tattoo artists should be able to upload designs to the app and curate a gallery for potential customers to “try on”.</li>
			</br>
			<li>Users who are considering a tattoo should be able to “try on” designs by certified artists as well as upload their own designs. They should also have a mechanism for saving photos and designs so as to better choose between options.</li>
		</ol>
		In order to satisfy both use cases, our initial design is mostly based on Fig 4’s model of a personal library and public profile. Drawing on Fig 1’s model, verified artists’ profiles are marked with a check. Users can browse designs by artist or just search for keywords. Every design can be used to take an A/R photo, which users save in their personal library.
		</p>
		<h5>Feedback</h5>
		<p>
		Next, we presented our design to a group of peers and asked for critiques. Most liked the app’s aesthetic, and appreciated the relatively simple layout. However, many said that they would not have understood the app’s purpose without our verbal explanations. They were confused about the difference between “personal” and “public” profiles, the landing page, and the meaning of different buttons. Additionally, while they appreciated the app’s social capabilities, they said that they were by far the least important element.
		</p>
		<h4>Hi-fi Prototype: Iteration 2</h4>
		<p>Based on the feedback we received, we realized that our app design was trying to fill too many roles at once. As a result, the interface was clunky and confusing. In the second iteration (<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/bHywNndKnT76kDsMpep7cu/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter-(Version-2.0)?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">view here</a>), we pared down the app to its most important feature: A/R tattoos. Now, when users open the app for the first time, text bubbles walk them through uploading a design and applying it to their arm in A/R. Users can upload tattoo designs from their phone library and save photos to an album in their phone library. Because the interface is so basic, users will not struggle to understand how to use the app. Instead, they can focus on trying on tattoos in A/R.</p>

		<h2>Eye Tracking</h2>
		<p>
		With the final iteration of our hifi prototype done, we used an eye tracker to analyze user engagement with an interface. We constructed a task for a user to perform with our prototype and hypothesized about the resulting time per screen and eye movement.
		</br></br>
Our given task was to pick the black and white flower design, take a picture with it, and save the picture to their camera roll.
		</p>
		<h4>Hypotheses</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>On the home page, the user’s eye will be drawn to the bottom of the screen, because we have a brightly colored button that will attract the user’s attention on a mostly monotone page.</li>
			</br>
			<li>In order to take a picture with the specified tattoo design, the user will start on the homepage, follow a series of onboarding screens to learn how to use the app, select the design from their pictures, take a picture, edit the picture, and then save the final product to their camera roll. All of the buttons are bright red, so users will have no problem navigating the app to take the desired picture.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Interpretation</h4>
		<h6>Home page</h6>
		<div class="two-col">
			<div id="inkhunter-left" class="left-col">
				<img class="img-col" src="./images/home-tracking.png" alt="Heat map of the home page"/>
			</div>
			<div id="inkhunter-right" class="right-col">
				Our eye-tracking tests supported the first part of our hypothesis. On the first page, our tester’s gaze focused mainly on the bottom left of the screen. The slight offset from the actual button itself may be attributed to a variety of causes. For instance, the left emphasis could have been influenced by standard Western left-to-right scripting. Furthermore, we observed that the calibration of the eye-tracker was slightly off (perhaps due to the contacts that our tester was wearing), an issue that persisted despite multiple attempts to recalibrate. The other focus points on the page similarly correspond to the brighter or higher contrast areas of the page; especially considering the dark background and theming of this app, this behavior matches our projected hypothesis, that the contrast between the background and the navigation would point users in the right direction.
			</div>
		</div>
		</br>
		<h6>Task Completion</h6>
		<p>
		Overall, our user followed our predictions for accomplishing the set tasks exactly. Thus, our second hypothesis was also supported by evidence from our test. Our user was able to complete the task in 34 seconds, navigating through 7 different screens.

		<div class="img-wrapper"><img class="content-img" src="./images/onboarding.png" alt="heatmap of the onboarding screens"/></div>
		</br>
		<p>
		Throughout the onboarding process, there are two different red buttons that move to the next page. While the first part of our hypothesis is true for a single page considered independently from consequent and previous pages, it fails to address the effect of the previous page on the eye movements on the current page. From the data it appears that consistency would be a much more effective tool in eliminating confusion in navigating between the three onboarding pages. From the below heatmaps, the patterns of where the user’s eyes spend the most time is fairly consistent from page to page, rather than always necessarily jumping around to the brightest spot.
		</p>
		<p><u>Design Selection:</u></p>
		<div class="img-wrapper"><img class="content-img" src="./images/design-selection.png" alt="heatmap of the edit and capture screens"/></div>
		</br>
		<p>
		The eye tracking data supports our hypothesis for the order in which these pages are navigated. The user quickly found the crucial buttons and was able to successfully navigate through to our objective.</p>
