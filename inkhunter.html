		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p style="text-align:center;">“Think before you ink.”</p>
		<p>
A tattoo is a decision that will follow you forever. Inkhunter is an augmented reality app that allows users to “try on” a tattoo to see how it would look on their skin, before making the final decision to book an appointment with a tattoo artist. As a startup, Inkhunter fills the gap between thinking about getting a tattoo and actually committing to an artist or shop. Inkhunter enables an expanded exploratory phase when considering tattoo possibilities. We were challenged to create a mobile app for InkHunter that is as innovative as InkHunter itself.
		</p>

		<h2>Design Process</h2>
		<h4>Sketches</h4>
		<p>
		To develop our prototype, we went through several increasingly high fidelity iterations. To start, each team member did a low-fi paper sketch of their proposed interface (<em>Figs 1–4</em>).

		<h4>Hi-fi Prototype: Iteration 1</h4>
		<p>
		Next, we combined elements from each of the sketches to create the first iteration of our prototype (<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/aJbJktEq8RvmG3XMSQSK1Cgr/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">view here</a>). Our primary goal was to facilitate two fundamentally different use cases:
		<ol>
			<li>Certified tattoo artists should be able to upload designs to the app and curate a gallery for potential customers to “try on.”</li>
			</br>
			<li>Users who are considering a tattoo should be able to “try on” designs by certified artists as well as upload their own designs. They should also have a mechanism for saving photos and designs so as to easily compare.</li>
		</ol>
		In order to satisfy both use cases, our initial design is mostly based on Fig 4’s model of a personal library and public profile. Drawing on Fig 1’s model, verified artists’ profiles are marked with a check. Users can browse designs by artist or just search for keywords. Every design can be used to take an A/R photo, which users save in their personal libraries.
		</p>
		<div class="img-wrapper">
			<img src="./images/inkhunter1.png" class="content-img">
			<p class="img-subtitle">Selected screens from the first prototype</p>
		</div></br>
		<h4>Hi-fi Prototype: Iteration 2</h4>
		<p>Next, we presented our design to a group of peers and asked for critiques. Based on the feedback we received, we realized that our app design was trying to fill too many roles at once. As a result, the interface was clunky and confusing. </br></br>In the second iteration (<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/bHywNndKnT76kDsMpep7cu/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter-(Version-2.0)?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">view here</a>), we pared down the app to its most important feature: A/R tattoos. Now, when users open the app for the first time, text bubbles walk them through uploading a design and applying it to their arm in A/R. Users can upload tattoo designs from their phone library and save photos to an album in their phone library. Because the interface is so basic, users will not struggle to understand how to use the app. Instead, they can focus on trying on tattoos in A/R.</p>

			<p class="img-subtitle">Selected screens from the second prototype</p>
		</div></br>

		<h2>Eye Tracking</h2>
		<p>
		With the final iteration of our hifi prototype done, we used an eye tracker to analyze user engagement with our interface. We asked users to pick the black and white flower design, take a picture with it, and save the picture to their camera roll.
		</p>
		We hypothesized that:
		<ol>
			<li>On the home page, the user’s eye will be drawn to the bottom of the screen, because we have a brightly colored button that will attract the user’s attention on a mostly monotone page.</li>
			<li>In order to take a picture with the specified tattoo design, the user will start on the homepage, follow a series of onboarding screens to learn how to use the app, select the design from their pictures, take a picture, edit the picture, and then save the final product to their camera roll. All of the buttons are bright red, so users will have no problem navigating the app to take the desired picture.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Data Interpretation</h4>
		<h6>Hypothesis 1</h6>
		<p>Our eye-tracking tests supported our first hypothesis. On the first page, our tester’s gaze focused mainly on the bottom of the screen, around the red button. The slight offset from the actual button is due to calibration issues with the eyetracker.</p>
		<div class="img-wrapper">
			<img style="max-height:400px;" src="./images/home-tracking.png" alt="Heat map of the home page">
			<p class="img-subtitle">Heat map of the user looking at the home page</p>
		</div>

		<h6>Hypothesis 2</h6>
		<p>
		The user navigated through seven different screens in the exact order we predicted, thus proving the first part of our second hypothesis. However, the second part of the hypothesis is that the user would have any easy time navigating through the pages because the buttons were red. We found this not to be true. Rather, it appears that consistency would be a much more effective tool in eliminating confusion in navigating between the three onboarding pages. From the below heatmaps, the patterns of where the user’s eyes spend the most time is fairly consistent from page to page, rather than jumping to the brightest spot.

		</div>


		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>From this project, I learned the importance of having a clear audience and goal in mind when you're designing an app. I also learned how to perform eye tracking experiments and animate the results in html and javascript to create the images you've seen here. Not to mention, I gained experience working in Figma, which will be useful in the future.
