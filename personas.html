		<p>
		Personas are a useful UI/UX design tool. They force designers to spend a lot of time thinking about and getting to know their audience, thus enabling them to better design suitable products. Additionally, personas help designers think of possible mental models for different users, encouraging them to think of systems that makes sense for different "types" of people within their audience. In doing so, designers are able make their product make sense to people from different backgrounds and stages of life.

		<p>I observed and interviewed users of the RIPTA payment interface to create two personas that encompass overarching trends among RIPTA users: Studious Sarah and Working Warren.</p>


		<h4>Persona 1: Studious Sarah</h4>
		<p>Studious Sarah is a high school student with a part-time job. She relies on RIPTA to get to both work and school, and is getting on the bus that will take her to school.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Thinks</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>I can’t be late for class today. I have a test!</li>
						<li>I should ask the school for a new pass. This one never works on the first try.</li>
						<li>When’s the bus getting here, again?</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Feels</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>Awkward around the older adults using RIPTA</li>
						<li>Stressed about her test</li>
						<li>Worried the bus will be late</li>
						<li>Embarrassed when her bus pass doesn’t work</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Says</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>“Sorry, excuse me”</li>
						<li>“Sorry, I don’t know why it’s not working.”</li>
						<li>“Three pi over two is… uhhh… 270 degrees. Yes!”</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Does</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>Swipe her ID multiple times before it works</li>
						<li>Study her flashcards in line and on the bus</li>
						<li>Check her phone to see the time</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table><br>
		<p>Sarah's mental model is that the user inserts cash, or swipes or taps a card, into the interface. A “beep” will sound, and the user can board the bus.</br></br>

Using Sarah's mental model, users assume that their interaction with the interface will be successful from the start. The users also do not consider the bus driver when they interact with the interface, even though the bus driver is the one who determines whether or not people can board. Rather, users assume that the beep is what allows them to enter.
		</p>


		<h4>Persona 2: Working Warren</h4>
		<p>Working Warren is a married, middle aged worker with a full-time job. He’s heading home for dinner with his family.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Thinks</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>Can this line move any slower?</li>
						<li>Not another person paying with cash…</li>
						<li>When’s the next time I need to reload my card?</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Feels</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>Tired after a long day, but proud of a job well done</li>
						<li>Impatient to get home</li>
						<li>Frustrated by people paying with cash</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Says</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>“Can we move things along here?”</li>
						<li>“Hi” (to the bus driver)</li>
						<li>(On the phone) “Hey Rebecca. What’s going on?”</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<strong>Does</strong></br>
					<ul>
						<li>Look at his watch</li>
						<li>Check work emails on his phone</li>
						<li>Play games</li>
						<li>Take a business call</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table><br>
		<p>Warren's mental model of the RIPTA payment interface is that the user swipes or taps a card, or inserts cash, into the interface. If the interaction is successful, a “beep” sounds, and the bus driver allows the user to enter the bus.
		<br><br>
Users who prescribe to this mental model of the RIPTA payment interface are not certain that their interaction will be successful on the first try. They will listen for the “beep” before they enter the main body of the bus, and also are aware that the bus driver is what allows them to enter the bus, not the beep.
		</p>


		<h4>Storyboard</h4>
		<p>I created a storyboard for Sarah to better understand her, and therefore RIPTA users like her. This process allows me, as a designer, to explore how a sample user experiences the RIPTA payment interface. Ideally, I can extend this practice to many types of users, and become more empathetic as a designer, in general.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>	
		Personas are an excellent thought experiment for getting to know your user base. That being said, it's not entirely created from the designer's imagination: going out and talking to users is incredibly important. It breaks down assumptions about users, which only improves the design of the product.
